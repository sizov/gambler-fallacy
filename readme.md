Very basic and quick test of Van Tharp 'Bias of the Gambler’s Fallacy'

Bias of the Gambler’s Fallacy
---------------------

The gambler’s fallacy is a natural consequence of the randomness bias. The gambler’s fallacy is the belief that when a
trend is established in a random sequence (or in the market, for that matter), the trend could change at any time. Thus,
after four consecutive up days in the market, we expect a down day. Even people who are well-respected researchers of
the market suffer from this bias. For example, Larry Williams, in my opinion, shows this bias in the following quote:
“After you have had three or four losing trades in a row, the probability of the next trade being not only a winner but
a substantial winner is way in your favor.”

When you understand what’s involved in winning, as do professional gamblers, you’ll tend to bet more during a winning
streak and less during a losing streak. However, the average person does exactly the opposite: he or she bets more after
a series of losses and less after a series of wins.

Ralph Vince once did an experiment with 40 Ph.D.s. 6 They were asked to play 100 trials of a simple computer game
in which they would win 60 percent of the time. They were each given $1,000 in play money and told to bet as much or as
little as they wished on each of the plays. None of the Ph.D.s knew about position sizing (that is, the effect of bet
size on the performance of such a game).

How many of them made money? Only 2 of the 40 participants had more than their original $1,000 at the end of the game—or
5 percent. But had they bet a constant $10 per bet, they would have ended up with about $1,200. And if they had bet
optimally for achieving the maximum gain (which was to risk 20 percent of their new equity each time—an approach not
advocated by this author), they would have ended up with about $7,490 (on average).

What happened? The participants tended to bet more after an adverse run and less after a favorable run. Let’s say the
first three bets are losers, and you bet $100 each time. Now you are down to $700. You think, “Since I’ve had three
losses in a row and the odds are 60 percent in my favor, I’m sure it’s time for a win.” As a result, you bet $400.
But you suffer another loss. Your stake is down to $300, and your chances of making it back are almost nonexistent.

The gambler’s fallacy bias enters into how most people develop trading systems, how they size their positions, and how
they trade. They totally ignore the randomness element. They look for certainty and trade their systems as if they had
it, not giving themselves enough protection. Thus, they don’t even consider position sizing as part of their system.
